# Project Description:
I wanted to find the best supplier to work with, and I will figure out what factors would help determine which is the best Supplier to work with, what is their most Popular product, what product could be better and is there a way to make more of the least purchase product and still be profitable? I will use some modeling to compare and contrast between the five suppliers, find the best one, and use mchine learning to figure out what is potentially the most proffitable product as well as find a way to take their lowest selling product and make it prodcue more revenue.

# The Plan:
Find data to work with, thread a story after a clean up, find conclusions after your findings.

# Data Dictionary:
Supplier: the one who creates the products
Costs: The total amount of costs from materials, producing, labor, and shipping
Revenue: The total revenue a product generates at a certain time.
Defect Rate: The likelyhood of a product defecting by a certain percentage (in this cae a low percentage is desireable).


# Reproduction:
Download the CSV at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshsingh2209/supply-chain-analysis, make sure it is in the same folder as your scripts, and check to make sure everything runs.

# Goals:
Find the most profitable Supplier, see if they also produce things cheaply, find their least popular product, and see if it's possible to make it better.

# Main Question/Hypothesis:
Who is the most profitable supplier? I would think it is someone who can produce things at a low price and be able to sell large quantities. Would it be possible to be even more profitable by adjusting your least popular product's stragedy? I think it can be more profitable to adjust the least popular product to become more desirable.

# Executive Summary:
My quest was to find a supplier who can offer popular goods that sell well and can be produced at cheap prices.  Supplier 3 has the lowest overall production costs and has sold more units compared to the other suppliers. 

# Conclusion/Recomendation/Next Steps:
Supplier 3 is the most reliable client to work with and they have large sales. Their most popular product would be hair care products, but it isn't the most profitable, that would be cosmetics.
One recomendation I have would perhaps have the amount of hair care be increased per product due to the price of the product being on the higher side, and  maybe to make it worth it for customers and entice them to purchase more. 
The nex steps I need take is to make a few more test about other products and perhaps explore more on what the other suppliers might offer.
