I want to find the best supplier to work with, I will figure out what factors would help determine that would determine which is the best Supplier to work with, what is their most Popular product, what product could be better and is there a way to make more of the least purchase product and still be profitable?

# Main Question/Hypothesis:
Who is the most profitable supplier? I would think it is someone who can produce things at a low price and be able to sell large quantities. Would it be possible to be even more profitable by adjusting your least popular product's stragedy? I think it can be more profitable to adjust the least popular product to become more desirable.
